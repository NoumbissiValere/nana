            The Blessing Ceremony of ABEBOH took place on Monday 12th September 2016. It was a call for the blessing of the occasion.
            Rev. Fr. Christophe came in from the University Parish to bless the Building. <br>
            It was an official kick start of ABEBOH . After the blessing ceremony which ended with a light refreshment, 
            The CEO turned to Facebook the next day to do a post with the following message
            "Hello All.
